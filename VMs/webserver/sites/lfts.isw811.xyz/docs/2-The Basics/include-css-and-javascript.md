# Adding CSS

In the public folder we should create a css folder in which we put all of our css. Back in the welcome view, we can reference this using a link:

```php
<link rel="stylesheet" href=/css/app.css>
```

This will position the pointer in the public folder and then go from there.

# Adding JavaScript

Including JS is the exact same, a new folder in the public folder with a reference in the view.php file.

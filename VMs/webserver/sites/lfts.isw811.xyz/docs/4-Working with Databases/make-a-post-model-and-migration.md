# Creating a migration

To cerate a migration, it's as easy as running the following command, with the last argument being the name of the migration.

```php
php artisan make:migration create_posts_table
php artisan make:model Post
```

And now we're ready to create and view a new post using the same commands as the ones we used in 'user'

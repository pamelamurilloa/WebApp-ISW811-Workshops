# Why Blade?

Blade brings a lot of advantages while working with php, like shorthand and commands that improve the html experience.
Blade compiles automatically all the views files to vanilla php, like scss does with css.

An example of this is to change

```php
 <?php foreach ($posts as $post) : ?>
```

To

```php
 @foreach ($posts as $post)
```

Also, blade provide things like premade methods to make php simpler.

[< Go Back](../README.md)

This is the final readme of this project. It says it's a 9 hour course but those are lies, I spent 33.22 hours, I have them counted.

I really hope you don't mind the language, all my code and comments are in English so I didn't think that I should have done these notes in Spanish and I was too far ahead to repent when I realized that maybe I should.

I have used Laravel before but the only thing in common with the stuff we saw in class was the language, the rest of the class were using Code Igniter but I decided to suffer instead.

All in all, I really enjoyed the course, there were things I did in that past project that he didn't show but I suppose it has more to do with the version he is using that the level of expertise between us, it's always a wonder to see people way more advanced than myself working, more so with how easy he makes it look.

It was also my first time doing a complete course so it was quite the trip. I'm sorry in advance if you were waiting for a summary of the things he said for this final video but a glimpse at my thoughts seemed more fitting.

Thank you for reading. I hope for you and your family to have all the health they may need.
